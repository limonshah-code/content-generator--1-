## What to Look for Before Buying the Best 2 Handle Shower Faucets

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you purchase, determine if you are doing a simple trim swap or a full plumbing renovation. Some sets require you to replace the valve behind the wall, which means opening up the tile. If you just want a quick refresh, look for kits compatible with your existing valve brand.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($50-$250)
A basic, reliable chrome faucet can be found for around $50 to $80. If you are looking for premium finishes like matte black or brushed nickel, expect to spend $100 to $150. High-end dual-head systems with brass valves can range from $180 to $250.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for the GPM (Gallons Per Minute) rating. A 1.8 GPM model is water-efficient, while a 2.5 GPM model offers a more powerful spray. Also, consider spray modes; more settings mean a more customized shower experience for different family members.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Solid brass is the gold standard for shower valves because it resists corrosion and handles high heat perfectly. For the exterior trim, stainless steel and high-grade finishes will prevent tarnishing. Avoid all-plastic components if you want the fixture to last more than a few years.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Brands like Kingston Brass and Pfister offer long-term warranties because they use standardized parts. Choosing a reputable brand ensures that if a cartridge fails in ten years, you can easily find a replacement at a local hardware store.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Measure the distance between your current handles. Most 2-handle systems use an 8-inch centerset. Ensure the shower arm length is appropriate for your shower stall size so you don't feel cramped against the wall.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy 2 handle shower faucets?

Investing in a high-quality 2 handle shower faucet is one of the smartest upgrades you can make for your home. Unlike single-handle models, these fixtures provide a symmetrical, classic look that never goes out of style. They offer much more precise control over the mix of hot and cold water, allowing you to dial in the perfect temperature every single time. 

From a maintenance perspective, two-handle systems are often easier to repair. If one side starts leaking, you only need to address that specific cartridge. Furthermore, these units are often built with heavier materials like solid brass, which increases the overall value of your home. Compared to modern alternatives, they provide a sense of stability and traditional luxury that many buyers look for in a well-maintained property. While they may require slightly more effort to install initially, the long-term reliability and aesthetic appeal make them a superior choice for many homeowners.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose 2 handle shower faucets?

Choosing the right faucet requires a step-by-step approach to ensure it fits your home and your lifestyle.

1. **Check Your Plumbing:** Determine if you have a 2-hole or 3-hole setup. This is the most critical step to ensure compatibility.
2. **Choose Your Finish:** Match the finish to your existing towel bars and cabinet hardware. Brushed nickel is great for hiding spots, while matte black makes a modern statement.
3. **Evaluate Water Pressure:** If you have low water pressure at home, look for a shower head with high-pressure nozzles or a 2.5 GPM rating.
4. **Consider Ease of Cleaning:** Look for silicone nozzles that can be wiped clean. This prevents lime scale from ruining your spray pattern.
5. **Set Your Budget:** Decide if you need a full valve replacement or just a trim kit. A full kit is more expensive but provides a fresh start for your plumbing.
6. **Look for Certifications:** WaterSense and ADA compliance are great indicators of a well-engineered product that will be safe and efficient.

**How do I maintain my 2 handle shower faucets?**
Clean them with a soft cloth and mild soap. Avoid harsh chemicals that can strip the finish, and rub the silicone nozzles occasionally to clear mineral buildup.
