## What to Look for Before Buying the Best 700 Watt Microwave Oven

### 1. Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before making a purchase, you must evaluate where the microwave will live and how often you will use it. If you are a student in a dorm, a 0.7 cubic foot model is usually the maximum size allowed. For an office, you might want a unit with a mute button to avoid disturbing coworkers. Consider if you primarily reheat coffee and leftovers or if you plan on defrosting meats for dinner daily, as some models have better defrosting technology than others.

### 2. Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
Most high-quality 700-watt microwaves fall within the $70 to $120 price range. Units on the lower end ($70-$90) usually offer standard features and plastic exteriors. Mid-range models ($90-$110) often include stainless steel finishes, mute buttons, and eco-modes. If you step up to $120 and above, you might find units with sensor technology or slightly higher wattages that offer more precision.

### 3. Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for features that make your life easier. Express cooking buttons (1-6 minutes) are a must for quick tasks. A +30 seconds button is equally important for fine-tuning. If you value silence, look for a dedicated mute mode. Safety features like a child lock are essential if you have small children. Also, check the turntable size; a 10-inch turntable is significantly more versatile than a 9-inch one for standard dinner plates.

### 4. Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Stainless steel exteriors generally offer better long-term durability and are easier to keep clean than plastic. Check the door mechanism; push-button releases are often more durable than latch-style handles that can wear out over time. Look for brands that offer at least a 1-year warranty, as this indicates the manufacturer has confidence in the longevity of their components.

### 5. Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Buying from established brands like Toshiba, Farberware, GE, or Black+Decker provides peace of mind. These companies have extensive customer support networks and their products are built to meet strict UL safety standards. They also tend to have more consistent quality control, meaning the 700 watts of power you are promised is exactly what you get.

### 6. Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Measure your countertop space before buying. Pay attention not just to the width and height, but also the depth. Some microwaves require a few inches of clearance in the back for proper ventilation. If you are placing it on an open shelf, ensure the shelf can handle the weight (usually around 20-25 pounds) and that the power cord is long enough to reach your outlet without an extension cord.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy 700 watt microwave oven?

Investing in a 700-watt microwave oven is a highly strategic decision for many households. While 1000-watt and 1200-watt models are common, they are often overkill for simple tasks like reheating a cup of tea or a plate of leftovers. A 700-watt unit consumes less energy and generates less heat, which is beneficial for the longevity of the appliance and your electricity bill. These units are specifically designed to fit into the compact lifestyles that many people now lead in urban environments.

Compared to larger alternatives, 700-watt microwaves are much more affordable and occupy significantly less precious countertop real estate. They are the go-to choice for studio apartments, tiny homes, and recreational vehicles. Long-term, you benefit from a simpler machine with fewer components that can fail. While they may take an extra minute to heat food compared to their high-powered cousins, the trade-off in space and cost is usually well worth it for the average user. If you find yourself mostly using a microwave for basic reheating, choosing a 700-watt model is a smart, efficient, and cost-effective choice.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose 700 watt microwave oven?

Choosing the right model requires a systematic approach to ensure you get the best value for your money. First, measure your available space and verify the internal dimensions; you want to make sure your favorite dinner plates actually fit inside. Second, prioritize your must-have features. Do you need a silent mode because you work late? Or is a stainless steel finish more important to match your kitchen decor?

A professional tip is to look at the weight of the unit. A slightly heavier microwave often indicates a more robust transformer and better shielding, which translates to a longer lifespan. Avoid the mistake of only looking at the price tag; a very cheap model might lack a rotating turntable, leading to unevenly cooked food. Always check user reviews specifically for the noise level and the brightness of the display, as these are common points of frustration. If you plan to use it for more than just reheating, look for a model with a multi-stage cooking function, which allows the microwave to transition from defrosting to cooking automatically. This professional-grade feature saves time and ensures better results for frozen meals.

### What features are most important in 700 watt microwave oven?
The most important features are a rotating glass turntable for even heating, a child safety lock for protection, and express cooking buttons for convenience. Additionally, a mute function is highly valued in small living spaces to prevent loud beeping. If you frequently cook from frozen, a defrost-by-weight feature is also a critical specification to look for.

### How do I maintain my 700 watt microwave oven?
Regular cleaning is the most important maintenance task. Wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and mild soap every few days to prevent food splatter from hardening. You should also remove and clean the glass turntable regularly; many are dishwasher safe. Ensure the ventilation vents are free of dust to prevent the unit from overheating during long cooking cycles.

### Are expensive 700 watt microwave oven worth it?
Expensive 700-watt models are worth it if they offer specific features you need, such as a stainless steel finish for durability or advanced sensor technology for precision. These models often have better internal components that can last several years longer than the cheapest alternatives. However, for basic reheating, a mid-priced model is usually the best value.

### What brands make the best 700 watt microwave oven?
Toshiba, Farberware, GE, and Black+Decker are the leaders in this category. These brands have established themselves by providing consistent power output and high safety standards.

### How long do 700 watt microwave oven typically last?
A well-maintained 700-watt microwave can typically last between 5 and 9 years. The lifespan depends heavily on how often it is used and how well it is cleaned.
