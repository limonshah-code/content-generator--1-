## What to Look for Before Buying the Best 700 Watt Microwave Oven

Choosing the right 700-watt microwave involves more than just picking the first one you see. Consider these key factors to ensure your new appliance meets your needs and provides lasting value.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
First, think about where and how you'll use the microwave. Is it for a tiny dorm room, a busy office breakroom, or a small apartment kitchen? The primary use will dictate the features you need. For an office, quick-start buttons are essential. For a dorm, a mute function might be a lifesaver for late-night studying. For a home kitchen, you might want more advanced features like multi-stage cooking or better defrosting capabilities.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations
700-watt microwaves are generally affordable, but prices can vary. You can expect to find solid, reliable models in the $70-$120 range. Basic, no-frills units might be slightly cheaper, while those with advanced features like superior defrosting technology, special coatings, or unique designs may be at the higher end of that range. Set a budget before you shop, but be willing to spend a little extra for a feature that you'll use every day, like a mute button or an energy-saving mode.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look beyond the wattage. Key features to consider include:
*   **Presets:** One-touch buttons for popcorn, pizza, and beverages add convenience.
*   **Power Levels:** More levels (10 or 11 is great) give you finer control for delicate tasks like melting chocolate.
*   **Turntable:** A removable glass turntable ensures even cooking and is easy to clean. Check its diameter to ensure your plates will fit.
*   **Control Panel:** Is it an intuitive keypad or a dial? Is the display bright and easy to read?
*   **Special Functions:** Look for extras like a mute button, eco mode, child lock, or a +30 seconds button.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
A microwave should be a long-term purchase. Look for a sturdy build. The door should open and close smoothly without feeling flimsy. Stainless steel exteriors often offer more durability and are easier to clean than plastic. Check the warranty; a one-year warranty is standard and indicates the manufacturer's confidence in their product.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Brands like GE, Toshiba, BLACK+DECKER, and Farberware have long histories of producing reliable kitchen appliances. While newer brands can offer innovative features, established manufacturers often provide better customer support and product longevity. Reading reviews for specific models can give you insight into a brand's current quality standards.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Measure your available counter space before you buy! Check the external dimensions (Width x Depth x Height) of the microwave in the product specifications. Also, consider the clearance needed around the unit for proper ventilation, which is usually a few inches on the top, back, and sides. A compact 0.7 cubic foot model is standard for this wattage and is designed specifically for tight spaces.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy 700 watt microwave oven?

Investing in a 700-watt microwave oven is an exceptionally wise decision for a significant number of people, particularly those dealing with space constraints or who have basic reheating and cooking needs. While higher-wattage models cook faster, a 700-watt unit is perfectly capable of handling everyday tasks like reheating leftovers, cooking frozen meals, making popcorn, and warming beverages. The primary advantage is its compact footprint, making it the ideal solution for apartments, dorm rooms, offices, RVs, and secondary kitchens where counter space is a precious commodity.

Compared to the alternative of having no microwave, the convenience it adds to daily life is immense. It saves time and energy compared to using a conventional oven for small tasks. Furthermore, 700-watt models are typically more energy-efficient and affordable than their larger, more powerful counterparts. The cost is minimal for the utility it provides, and the long-term benefits of quick, easy meals and saved time are substantial. For anyone who doesn't require the speed and capacity to cook large family meals from scratch, a 700-watt microwave is not a compromise; it's the smart, practical, and cost-effective choice.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose 700 watt microwave oven?

Choosing the best 700-watt microwave oven involves a methodical approach to match the product to your specific lifestyle. Follow these steps for a confident purchase.

**Step 1: Assess Your Space and Primary Use**
Before anything else, measure the space where the microwave will live. Note the maximum width, depth, and height. Think about its main purpose. Will it be for reheating coffee in the office, making late-night ramen in a dorm, or defrosting meat for dinner in an apartment? Your primary use will highlight which features are most important.

**Step 2: Define Your Must-Have Features**
Create a short list of non-negotiable features. For a family with kids, a robust child lock is a must. If you're sensitive to noise, a mute function is essential. For the energy-conscious, an ECO mode is a priority. Other popular features include one-touch express cook buttons, specific food presets, and multiple power levels.

**Step 3: Set Your Budget and Research Brands**
Decide how much you are comfortable spending. Within your budget, look at models from reputable brands known for reliability, such as GE, Toshiba, and Farberware. Read recent reviews to get a sense of current product quality and customer satisfaction.

**Step 4: Compare Your Top 3 Choices**
Narrow your options down to three top contenders. Create a simple comparison chart looking at their dimensions, key features, user review scores, and price. This side-by-side view will often make the best choice clear. Pay attention to minor drawbacks mentioned in reviews—what might be a small annoyance to one person could be a deal-breaker for you.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
*   **Ignoring Dimensions:** Don't just assume it will fit. Measure twice, buy once.
*   **Focusing Only on Price:** The cheapest option may lack durability or essential features, costing you more in the long run.
*   **Overlooking the User Interface:** A confusing control panel can make a simple task frustrating. Look for clear, intuitive controls.
