## What to Look for Before Buying the Best 84 Inch Shower Curtain

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you make a purchase, determine if you need a standalone curtain or a liner. If your shower rod is mounted higher than the standard 72 inches, the 84-inch length is non-negotiable to prevent water from escaping at the bottom. Consider if your bathroom has high humidity levels, which might favor faster-drying materials like PEVA or treated polyester.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($15-$45 ranges)
Setting a budget is crucial. Basic PEVA liners typically fall in the $15-$25 range and are excellent for functional water containment. If you are looking for luxury fabric, waffle weaves, or 2-in-1 decorative curtains with waterproof backings, expect to spend between $30 and $45. Investing slightly more often gets you higher GSM fabric and better magnet systems.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for weighted hems or bottom magnets; these are essential for an 84-inch curtain because the extra length creates more surface area for the chimney effect to pull the curtain inward. Rust-resistant metal grommets are also vital for durability, as they prevent the hanging holes from tearing under the weight of the longer fabric.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Check the GSM (Grams per Square Meter) for fabric curtains. Anything above 200 GSM is considered heavy-duty and will drape much better than thinner alternatives. For plastic liners, check for reinforced headers. The quality of the stitching and the strength of the magnets are the best indicators of how long the product will last in a moisture-rich environment.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
While many brands exist, those like Barossa Design and AmazerBath have established themselves as leaders in the 84-inch market. Established brands often provide better customer service and use safer materials like BPA-free PEVA. Reading user reviews specifically regarding how the length holds up after washing can provide insight into the brand's manufacturing quality.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Ensure you have measured your space correctly. An 84-inch curtain is significantly longer than standard, so if your rod isn't high enough, it will bunch at the bottom and collect mold. Also, consider the width; most of these are 72 inches wide, which is standard, but you should verify this matches your tub or walk-in shower dimensions.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy 84 inch shower curtain?

Investing in an 84-inch shower curtain is an excellent decision for anyone with a non-standard bathroom layout. Standard 72-inch curtains often leave a gap at the bottom when used with high-mounted rods, leading to water damage on your floors and baseboards. By choosing the extra length, you ensure a complete seal that keeps moisture where it belongs.

Furthermore, the aesthetic upgrade is significant. Taller curtains create a vertical line that draws the eye upward, making your bathroom feel more spacious and luxurious, similar to a high-end hotel suite. While the cost is slightly higher than standard sizes, the benefits of improved water containment and superior visual appeal provide long-term value that far outweighs the initial investment.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose 84 inch shower curtain?

Choosing the best option involves a few simple steps. First, measure from your rod to the floor and subtract one to two inches to ensure the curtain doesn't drag. Second, decide between the clarity of PEVA or the softness of polyester. If you prefer a decorative look, a fabric curtain paired with a separate liner is usually the best professional approach.

Avoid common mistakes like ignoring the magnet weight. Without magnets, long curtains tend to billow more than short ones. If you have a metal tub, always look for curtains with at least three magnets. For walk-in showers with tile floors, look for heavy-duty GSM fabrics that stay in place through gravity alone. Upgrading to a 2-in-1 waterproof fabric curtain is often the best choice for those wanting to simplify their laundry routine.
