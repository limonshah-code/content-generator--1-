## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Barbecue Presses Under 20

Choosing the right barbecue press can significantly improve your cooking. Here are the key factors to consider to ensure you get the best tool for your needs and budget.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
First, think about what you'll be cooking most often. If you love crispy, flat bacon, a rectangular press like the **Stanbroil Stainless Steel Press** is ideal. For perfect smash burgers, a heavy, round press like the **Outset Cast Iron Press** provides the best results. Also, consider your cooking surface. Most presses work on grills, flat tops, and skillets, but make sure the size and shape are compatible with your most-used cookware.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
The great news is that you don't have to spend a lot to get a high-quality barbecue press. All the products on our list fall under the $20 mark. In the $10-$15 range, you can find excellent budget options like the **onlyfire Cast Iron Press**. In the slightly higher $15-$20 range, you'll find more specialized or heavy-duty models. Set your budget based on your primary needs and how often you plan to use the press.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
*   **Weight:** Heavier presses (2-3 lbs) are better for searing thick cuts of meat and smashing burgers. Lighter presses (1-2 lbs) are easier to handle and sufficient for bacon or sandwiches.
*   **Surface Texture:** A ridged or grooved surface creates classic grill marks, while a flat surface provides a more uniform, all-over crust, ideal for smash burgers.
*   **Handle Design:** Look for a handle that stays cool to the touch. Wood or silicone-wrapped handles are the safest options. Integrated cast iron handles will get extremely hot and require an oven mitt.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
The two main materials are cast iron and stainless steel.
*   **Cast Iron:** Offers superior heat retention and weight. It's incredibly durable but requires seasoning and careful cleaning to prevent rust.
*   **Stainless Steel:** It is rust-proof, lightweight, and very easy to clean. It doesn't retain heat as well as cast iron but is a great low-maintenance option.
Check that handles are securely attached, preferably with screws rather than just being glued on.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
While many smaller brands make excellent presses, established manufacturers like Farberware can offer peace of mind with a reputation for quality and customer service. Reading user reviews for any brand, big or small, is crucial to gauge long-term durability and performance.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Consider the dimensions of the press. A large 9-inch press is great for cooking for a family but will take up more space in your kitchen drawer or on your grill. A smaller 7-inch press is more versatile and easier to store. If you plan to take it camping, a more compact and durable cast iron model might be the best choice.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy barbecue presses under 20?

Absolutely. Investing in a barbecue press, especially one under $20, is one of the most cost-effective ways to elevate your cooking. Many people try to replicate the effect with a spatula or a foil-wrapped brick, but these methods are clumsy and apply uneven pressure, leading to inconsistent results. A dedicated press provides uniform weight across the entire surface of your food.

The long-term benefits are significant. You'll achieve faster cooking times because the press heats from the top while the pan heats from the bottom. You'll get that coveted, delicious crust on burgers and steaks known as the Maillard reaction. For healthier eating, a press is invaluable for squeezing out excess grease from bacon and ground meat.

Compared to more expensive grilling gadgets, a simple press offers a huge return on investment. It's a durable, single-piece tool (often just cast iron or steel) that will last for decades with minimal care. For less than the cost of a couple of fancy coffee drinks, you get a tool that improves the quality, texture, and even the healthiness of your food every time you use it. It's a small price to pay for consistently better meals.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose barbecue presses under 20?

Choosing the right barbecue press is simple if you follow a few key steps. Here's a guide to help you find the perfect one for your kitchen.

**Step-by-Step Selection Guide:**
1.  **Identify Your Primary Use:** Are you a bacon fanatic, a smash burger specialist, or a steak searing pro? Your main goal will determine the best shape and weight. Rectangular for bacon, heavy and round for burgers.
2.  **Choose Your Material:** Decide between the high-heat performance of cast iron and the low-maintenance convenience of stainless steel. If you don't mind a little upkeep, cast iron is a performance king. If you value ease of cleaning above all, go with stainless steel.
3.  **Check the Handle:** Safety first. Prioritize a wood or silicone handle that will stay cool. If you choose a model with an integrated metal handle, be sure you have a good oven mitt or grill glove ready.
4.  **Consider the Size:** Match the press size to your favorite skillet or the typical amount of food you cook. Don't get a press that's too big for your pan.

**Professional Tips:**
*   **Preheat Your Press:** For the best sear, place your press on the grill or in the pan to heat up alongside your food. A hot press on a hot steak creates an incredible crust.
*   **Oil Your Press:** Lightly oil your cast iron press before use to prevent sticking, especially with leaner meats.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
*   **Pressing Too Early:** Don't press your burger patty the second it hits the griddle. Let it sear for 30-60 seconds to form a slight crust, then smash it.
*   **Neglecting Maintenance:** Don't put your cast iron press in the dishwasher or let it air dry. This will lead to rust. Always hand wash, dry immediately and thoroughly, and apply a thin layer of cooking oil.
