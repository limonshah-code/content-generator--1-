## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Bisque Over The Range Microwave

Choosing the right over-the-range (OTR) microwave involves more than just picking a color. It's about finding an appliance that fits your space, meets your cooking needs, and offers the right features for your lifestyle. Here’s a detailed guide to help you make the best choice.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
First, assess how you'll use the microwave. Are you a gourmet cook who needs advanced features like convection or sensor cooking? Or do you primarily use it for reheating leftovers and making popcorn? Consider your family size. A large 1.9-2.0 cu. ft. model is great for big families, while a more compact 1.5-1.7 cu. ft. unit suffices for smaller households. Most importantly, measure your space. Standard OTR microwaves are 30 inches wide to fit above a standard range, but always check the height and depth to ensure it fits with your cabinetry.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
Over-the-range microwaves have a wide price spectrum. Basic models with standard features typically range from **$250 to $400**. These are great for essential heating and defrosting. Mid-range models, from **$400 to $700**, often include more powerful ventilation (300-400 CFM), sensor cooking, and larger capacities. High-end microwaves, costing **$700 and up**, will feature premium functionalities like convection cooking, air frying, smart home connectivity, and sleek, modern designs. Set a budget that aligns with the features you truly need.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
- **Wattage:** Look for at least 1000 watts for fast, even cooking. Lower wattage models will take longer to heat food.
- **Ventilation Power (CFM):** CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) measures how much air the fan can move. For electric stovetops, 300 CFM is generally sufficient. For gas ranges, which produce more heat and fumes, aim for 400 CFM or higher.
- **Sensor Cooking:** This feature uses sensors to detect steam and automatically adjusts cooking time and power for optimal results. It prevents overcooking and is incredibly convenient.
- **Convection/Air Fry:** These features turn your microwave into a second oven, allowing you to bake, roast, and get crispy results. It's a great space-saver.
- **Turntable Options:** A large turntable ensures even cooking. A feature to turn the turntable off is a bonus, allowing you to use large, rectangular dishes.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
Look for models with a sturdy door and handle, as these are the most frequently used parts. A stainless steel cavity is more durable and easier to clean than a plastic one. Check for a strong warranty, like the 2-year warranty offered by Empava, as it indicates the manufacturer's confidence in their product. Reading user reviews can also provide insight into the long-term durability of a specific model.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Brands like GE, BLACK+DECKER, and Farberware have long-standing reputations for producing reliable appliances. Established brands typically offer better customer service and easier access to replacement parts if something goes wrong. While newer brands can offer innovative features, it's wise to check their reviews and warranty policies carefully before purchasing.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
While OTR microwaves are not portable, their size is a critical factor. Ensure the dimensions will fit in the allocated space above your range. Pay close attention to the depth to make sure it doesn't protrude too far from your cabinets, which can be a hazard. If you have lower cabinets, a "slim" or "low-profile" model like the Midea can provide more clearance over your cooktop.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy bisque over the range microwave?

Investing in a quality over-the-range microwave is a very wise decision for most modern kitchens. The primary advantage is its space-saving design. By combining two essential appliances—a microwave and a range hood—into one, it frees up valuable counter space that would otherwise be occupied by a standalone microwave. This creates a cleaner, more streamlined look and provides more room for meal preparation.

Compared to the alternative of a separate countertop microwave and a dedicated range hood, an OTR unit is often more cost-effective and simpler to install. A good quality range hood alone can be expensive, and an OTR microwave provides effective ventilation (look for models with at least 300 CFM) for the average home cook, clearing smoke, steam, and odors.

The long-term benefits are significant. Modern OTR microwaves are packed with technology that simplifies cooking, from sensor reheat functions that warm leftovers perfectly to multi-stage cooking programs for complex recipes. Models with convection and air fry capabilities can even reduce the need for other small appliances, further decluttering your kitchen. While the initial cost may seem like a significant outlay, the daily convenience, improved kitchen workflow, and enhanced functionality make it a valuable and practical investment that you will appreciate for years to come.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose bisque over the range microwave?

Choosing the best over-the-range microwave requires a methodical approach to ensure it meets all your needs. Follow this step-by-step guide for a confident purchase.

**Step 1: Measure Your Space Accurately**
Before you even start browsing, grab a tape measure. Measure the width, height, and depth of the space above your range. The standard width is 30 inches, but heights and depths can vary. Ensure you have enough clearance above your cooktop (check manufacturer recommendations, but it's typically 13-16 inches).

**Step 2: Define Your Cooking Style and Needs**
Be honest about how you cook. If you're a "reheat and defrost" user, a basic 1000W model will suffice. If you're an avid cook, consider advanced features. Sensor cooking is a must-have for convenience, and convection/air fry functions are game-changers for those who want a second oven.

**Step 3: Determine Your Ventilation Requirements**
Do you have an electric or gas range? Gas stoves require more powerful ventilation. We recommend a minimum of 300 CFM for electric and 400 CFM for gas. Also, check if you can vent to the outside (exterior venting) or if you need a recirculating (ductless) model that uses charcoal filters. Most OTR microwaves are convertible.

**Step 4: Set Your Budget and Compare Features**
Decide on a price range you're comfortable with. Once you have a budget, compare models within that range. Prioritize features that you'll use most. Don't pay extra for a feature like smart-home connectivity if you know you won't use it.

**Step 5: Read Reviews and Check Warranties**
Look for user reviews on multiple websites to get a balanced view of a product's real-world performance and longevity. Pay attention to comments about noise level, ease of use, and customer service. A longer warranty, like one or two years, is a good indicator of a quality product.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Forgetting to measure:** The most common mistake is buying a microwave that doesn't fit.
- **Underestimating ventilation needs:** A weak fan won't clear smoke and odors, leaving your kitchen smelly.
- **Ignoring user interface:** A control panel that isn't intuitive will be a source of daily frustration.

## FAQ

### What is the best bisque over the range microwave for beginners?
For beginners, the best option is one that is user-friendly and reliable. The **Farberware 1.7 Cu. Ft. Microwave** is an excellent choice.

Its 1000 watts of power are more than sufficient for all basic tasks, making it a great, no-fuss appliance to learn on without being overwhelmed by complicated features.

### How much should I spend on bisque over the range microwave?
A good quality over-the-range microwave typically costs between $300 and $600. In this range, you can find models with excellent features like 1000 watts of power, effective 300-400 CFM ventilation, and sensor cooking. Budget models can be found for under $300, while premium models with convection, air frying, and smart features can exceed $700. The sweet spot for most users is around $400.

### What features are most important in bisque over the range microwave?
The three most important features are adequate wattage (1000W+), effective ventilation (at least 300 CFM), and a size that fits your space and cooking needs (1.6-1.9 cu. ft. is standard). After these basics, sensor cooking is the next most valuable feature for its convenience and ability to prevent overcooking. A turntable on/off function is also very useful for accommodating larger dishes.

### How do I maintain my bisque over the range microwave?
Maintenance is simple. Wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and mild detergent regularly to prevent food splatters from hardening. Clean the turntable in the dishwasher or by hand. For the exterior, use a cleaner appropriate for the finish (e.g., stainless steel cleaner or a gentle all-purpose cleaner). Most importantly, clean or replace the grease and charcoal filters every 3-6 months to ensure the ventilation system works effectively.

### Are expensive bisque over the range microwave worth it?
They can be, depending on your needs. Expensive models often include convection and air fry functions, which can effectively replace a second oven and a countertop air fryer, saving space and adding versatility. They may also feature more powerful ventilation, smarter cooking sensors, and premium finishes.

Key components like the magnetron (which generates microwaves) or the control panel are often the first parts to fail. Investing in a model with a good warranty can provide protection for the first few years.
