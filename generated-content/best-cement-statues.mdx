## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Cement Statues

### Find Your Need
When selecting a cement statue, consider where you plan to display it. For entryways, a taller piece like a porch goose might be ideal, whereas smaller animal figurines are perfect for flower beds. If you want something functional, look for statue-planter hybrids that can hold your favorite greenery.

### Budget
Cement statues typically range from $15 for small accents to over $60 for larger, more detailed portrait planters. Determine if you want a simple molded piece or a hand-painted, highly detailed work of art. Setting a realistic range will help you choose between smaller figurines and substantial garden focal points.

### Key Features
Weight is one of the most important technical aspects of cement decor. A heavier statue is less likely to blow over in the wind. Also, look for features like magnetic attachments for customization or included liners for planters that lack drainage holes.

### Quality & Durability
Ensure the product is made from solid cement or a high-strength resin-cement mix. Check if there is a protective coating to prevent fading from UV rays. Solid-filled statues are generally more durable and offer a more premium feel than hollow alternatives.

### Brand Reputation
Look for brands that prioritize careful packaging, such as using custom styrofoam inserts, as cement can be fragile during shipping. Established manufacturers often provide better customer service and more consistent hand-painted details.

### Portability/Size
Consider the weight if you plan to move the statue frequently. A 4-5 lb statue is easy to reposition, but larger 11-inch cement busts can be quite heavy once filled with soil and plants. Ensure your shelving or pedestals can support the weight.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy cement statues?

Investing in cement statues is a wise decision for anyone looking to add permanent beauty and character to their home or garden. Unlike plastic or thin resin alternatives, cement pieces offer a timeless aesthetic that matures beautifully over time. They are inherently more resistant to wind, making them a practical choice for areas prone to storms or high breezes.

While the initial cost might be slightly higher than lightweight plastic ornaments, the long-term benefits of durability and stability provide far better value. Cement statues do not crack as easily in freezing temperatures and are less likely to fade rapidly under intense sunlight when properly coated. They serve as multi-generational decor that can be passed down or remain a staple in your landscape for decades. Compared to alternatives, they provide a sense of quality and permanence that truly elevates the perceived value of your property.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose cement statues?

Choosing the right cement statue involves a few strategic steps. First, measure the space where the statue will sit to ensure the proportions are correct. A statue that is too small can get lost in a large garden, while one that is too large might overwhelm a small porch.

Next, consider the theme of your existing decor. If you have a classical garden, a Greek bust planter would be a perfect match. For a more whimsical or cottage-style garden, animal figurines like bunnies and birds work best. Always check the product weight in the specifications to ensure it meets your stability needs.

Avoid common mistakes like ignoring drainage requirements for planters. If a cement planter lacks a hole, always use a plastic liner or a layer of gravel to protect the statue and your plants. Finally, if you are a beginner, starting with a versatile piece like a porch goose allows you to experiment with different looks throughout the year.

## FAQ

**What is the best cement statues for beginners?**
For beginners, a medium-sized animal figurine like a cement bird or a small bunny is best. These are affordable, easy to place in any garden nook, and require no maintenance. They allow you to test how cement pieces look in your space before investing in larger, heavier items.

**How much should I spend on cement statues?**
Most high-quality small to medium cement statues cost between $20 and $45. If you are looking for a large portrait planter or a highly detailed custom piece, expect to spend closer to $60. This price range usually ensures solid construction and a weather-resistant finish.

**What features are most important in cement statues?**
Weight and finish are the most critical features. A heavy statue stays upright during wind, while a high-quality protective finish prevents the cement from crumbling or fading in the sun. If it is a planter, the inclusion of a liner is also very helpful.

**How do I maintain my cement statues?**
Maintenance is minimal. Simply wipe them down with a damp cloth to remove dirt or debris. If the statue is placed in an area with extreme freezing and thawing cycles, you might want to bring it indoors or cover it during winter to prevent small surface cracks.

**Are expensive cement statues worth it?**
Yes, more expensive options often feature higher-strength cement mixes and better hand-painted details. They are also more likely to be solid-filled rather than hollow, providing much better stability and a more authentic feel that lasts for many years.

**What brands make the best cement statues?**
Brands like Lamiaraga, Zokyntrix, and Lucky Winner are well-regarded for their craftsmanship. They offer a variety of styles, from whimsical geese to classical Greek busts, and consistently receive positive feedback for their durable materials and secure shipping practices.

**How long do cement statues typically last?**
With proper care, a cement statue can last for decades. Unlike plastic which becomes brittle, cement is naturally rugged. Applying a clear masonry sealer every few years can further extend the life of the finish and protect against moisture penetration.

**Can I find good cement statues on a budget?**
Absolutely. Many small bird and rabbit figurines are available for under $25. These budget options still offer the weight and durability of cement, making them a great value for those looking to enhance their garden without a large investment.
