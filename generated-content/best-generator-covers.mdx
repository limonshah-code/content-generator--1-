## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Generator Covers

Choosing the right generator cover involves more than just finding one that fits. To protect your investment properly, you need to consider how and where you'll use it. This guide will help you navigate the key factors to ensure you select the perfect cover for your needs.

### Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
First, determine your primary use case. Do you need a cover to protect the generator while it's in storage, or do you need a specialized tent or enclosure that allows you to run it safely in bad weather? A **storage cover** is typically a simple, fitted fabric cover, while a **running cover** is a more complex structure with a metal frame and ventilation. Next, measure your generator's length, width, and height. Always compare these measurements to the cover's listed dimensions to ensure a proper fit. Pay attention to compatibility notes for specific generator types, like open-frame versus inverter generators, as some covers are designed for a particular style.

### Budget - Setting realistic price expectations
Generator cover prices can vary significantly. Basic, good-quality storage covers, like those from Porch Shield, typically range from **$25 to $50**. These offer excellent value for protecting your unit from the elements when not in use. For heavy-duty running covers that function as all-weather tents, such as those from GenArmor or IGAN, expect to invest **$130 to $200**. While the upfront cost is higher, these covers allow you to use your generator safely during the storms and power outages when you need it most, making them a worthwhile investment for emergency preparedness.

### Key Features - Most important technical specifications
For storage covers, look for waterproof or water-resistant fabric (like 600D or 900D polyester), UV protection to prevent fading and material degradation, and a secure fastening system like drawstrings and buckle straps to keep it on in the wind. For running covers, the key features are a sturdy frame (stainless steel is best), 100% waterproof material (heavy tarpaulin is common), adequate ventilation to prevent overheating, and easy-access flaps for refueling and connecting cables.

### Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
High-quality construction is vital for a cover that will last. Look for double-stitched seams, as this reinforces the fabric and prevents tearing under stress. For waterproof covers, taped seams are a must-have feature; this is a waterproof strip applied over the stitching to prevent any water from leaking through the needle holes. The fabric's denier (D) rating indicates its thickness and durability—a higher number like 600D or 900D is better. For running covers, check the frame's material and thickness to ensure it's robust enough to handle wind and snow.

### Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
Sticking with reputable brands like **GenArmor, IGAN, Porch Shield, Champion, and Westinghouse** provides a level of assurance. These companies have a track record of producing reliable products and often stand behind them with solid warranties and customer service. Reading user reviews for specific models can also give you real-world insight into a cover's long-term performance and durability. A trusted brand is more likely to use quality materials and honor its warranty claims.

### Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
For storage covers, this is less of an issue as they fold down compactly. For running covers with frames, consider the assembly and disassembly process. Look for tool-free designs that are easy to set up quickly in an emergency. Also, think about where you will store the cover when it's not in use. Models that come with a storage bag are a convenient bonus. Ensure the cover's size is appropriate for your generator—a cover that is too tight can be difficult to put on and may tear, while one that is too loose can flap in the wind and may not provide adequate protection.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy generator covers?

Absolutely. Investing in a high-quality generator cover is one of the smartest and most cost-effective decisions you can make to protect your equipment. A generator is often a purchase made for emergency preparedness, and its reliability is paramount. Leaving it exposed to the elements—rain, snow, harsh sun, humidity, and dust—can lead to a host of problems. Rain can cause rust on the frame and critical engine components, and moisture can damage sensitive electrical outlets and control panels, leading to costly repairs or complete failure. UV rays from the sun can degrade plastic parts, fade paint, and cause hoses to become brittle and crack.

Compared to the alternative of leaving it unprotected or using a simple, ill-fitting plastic tarp, a dedicated generator cover is far superior. Tarps can trap moisture underneath, potentially causing more harm than good by creating a humid environment ripe for rust and corrosion. A proper cover is designed with breathable or ventilated fabric to prevent this.

The long-term benefits far outweigh the initial cost. A cover that costs between $30 and $150 can protect a generator that costs anywhere from $500 to several thousand dollars. It extends the functional life of your generator, ensures it looks good for years, and, most importantly, provides peace of mind that it will start and run safely when you need it most. It's a small price to pay for reliability during a power outage.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose generator covers?

Choosing the best generator cover is a systematic process. By following these steps, you can ensure you get the right protection for your specific needs and avoid common pitfalls.

**Step 1: Define Your Primary Need**
First, be clear about your purpose. Are you looking for a cover to protect your generator while it's in storage in your garage or shed? Or do you live in a storm-prone area and need the ability to run your generator safely in the rain? Your answer determines whether you need a basic **storage cover** or a more robust **running cover**.

**Step 2: Measure Your Generator Accurately**
Grab a tape measure and get the precise dimensions of your generator: Length (L), Width (W), and Height (H). Make sure to measure the widest points, but typically exclude extended handles or wheels unless the cover manufacturer specifies otherwise. Compare your measurements to the cover's listed dimensions. Always choose a cover that is slightly larger, but not excessively so.

**Step 3: Evaluate Material and Construction**
- **For Storage Covers:** Look for a high denier rating (600D polyester is a great standard, 900D is even better). Ensure it is listed as waterproof or highly water-resistant and has UV protection. Check for double-stitched and taped seams.
- **For Running Covers:** The material should be 100% waterproof heavy-duty tarpaulin. The frame is critical; look for sturdy steel or, even better, stainless steel for rust resistance.

**Step 4: Check for Essential Features**
- **Secure Fastening:** An elastic hem, drawstrings, and buckle straps are crucial for keeping a storage cover in place.
- **Ventilation:** Good covers have vents to allow air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.
- **Accessibility:** For running covers, look for easy-access panels for the fuel tank, outlets, and control panel. A tool-free setup is a major bonus.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Buying the Wrong Size:** A cover that's too small won't fit, and one that's too big can pool water or be blown away by the wind.
- **Using a Storage Cover for Running:** This is a serious fire and safety hazard. Storage covers are not designed to handle the heat and exhaust from a running generator.
- **Ignoring Ventilation:** A non-ventilated cover can trap moisture, leading to rust and mold.

**When to Upgrade vs. Budget Options:**
A budget storage cover is perfectly adequate if you store your generator indoors or in a covered area. However, if your generator is stored outdoors and exposed to harsh weather year-round, it is wise to upgrade to a more durable model like the QH.HOME 900D cover. If there is any chance you will need to run your generator during a hurricane, snowstorm, or heavy rain, investing in a high-quality running cover like those from GenArmor or IGAN is not a luxury—it's a necessity for safety and reliability.

For running covers, inspect the frame for any damage or rust before each use and ensure all flaps and zippers are working correctly.

**Are expensive generator covers worth it?**
Yes, if they meet your needs. An expensive running cover like the IGAN or GenArmor models is worth every penny if you live in an area with frequent storms, as it allows you to safely generate power. For storage, a premium cover like the QH.HOME 900D is worth it for its superior durability and longevity, especially if your generator is stored outdoors.
