## What to Look for Before Buying the Best High End Toilet

### Find Your Need
Before purchasing, determine your specific bathroom requirements. Are you retrofitting an old space or building new? Measure your rough-in distance carefully; 12 inches is standard, but some older homes require 10 inches. Consider whether you prefer an elongated bowl for comfort or a round bowl to save space in tight powder rooms.

### Budget
High-end toilets vary significantly in price. Standard one-piece luxury models typically range from $300 to $600. If you move into smart territory with bidets and auto-open lids, expect to spend between $800 and $1,800. Setting a realistic budget helps you decide which features are essential versus nice-to-have.

### Key Features
Look for a high MAP (Maximum Performance) score, ideally 1000 grams, to ensure a single flush is always enough. Water efficiency is also vital; look for WaterSense certification or dual-flush options that use less than 1.28 GPF. These features save money and reduce environmental impact over time.

### Quality & Durability
High-end toilets should be made from vitreous china fired at high temperatures. This creates a non-porous surface that resists stains and bacteria. Look for fully glazed trapways, which prevent clogs and ensure a smooth transit of waste. Check for sturdy seat hinges, preferably stainless steel or high-quality polymers.

### Brand Reputation
Stick with established manufacturers like SOTOMO, HOROW, and EPLO. These brands offer better warranties and have customer service teams that can assist with replacement parts. Reliable brands also provide clear installation videos and instructions, which are crucial for high-end fixtures.

### Portability/Size
One-piece toilets are sleek but heavy, so consider the logistics of moving them into your bathroom. If you have a small ensuite, look for compact elongated models that offer the comfort of a full-size toilet with a shorter overall depth. Always check the total height to ensure it fits under any existing cabinets.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy high end toilet?

Investing in a high-end toilet is a wise decision for several long-term reasons. First, the construction quality of premium toilets far exceeds budget options. By using better glazes and firing processes, these toilets remain cleaner and resist the hard water stains that plague cheaper models. This means less scrubbing and fewer chemical cleaners are needed over the years.

Second, the flushing technology is superior. A high-end unit often pays for itself through reduced water bills and the avoidance of costly plumber visits for clogs. While a standard toilet might need multiple flushes, a model with a 1000g MAP score clears the bowl effectively every time.

Finally, the added comfort features like ADA-compliant height or smart bidet functions significantly improve your quality of life. As we age, ergonomic features become more important, and having a toilet that assists with mobility can prolong independence. When you consider that a toilet is a fixture you will use every single day for decades, the initial investment in a high-end model is well worth the daily dividends of comfort and reliability.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose high end toilet?

Choosing the best model involves a step-by-step approach to ensure it fits both your body and your bathroom. Follow these professional tips to make the right choice:

1. **Measure Your Space:** Always start with the rough-in (the distance from the wall to the center of the floor bolts). Also, measure the total depth available to ensure the door can swing freely.
2. **Determine the Height:** If you are tall or have knee issues, opt for an ADA-compliant or extra-tall model. If children primarily use the bathroom, a standard height might be more appropriate.
3. **Choose the Style:** One-piece toilets are easier to clean and look more modern, while two-piece toilets are lighter and easier to install for DIYers. Skirted designs are the current high-end trend for aesthetic simplicity.
4. **Evaluate Smart Features:** Decide if you want a built-in bidet. If you do, ensure you have a GFCI electrical outlet within reach of the toilet location.
5. **Check Performance Ratings:** Never buy a toilet without checking its MAP score. Aim for at least 800g, though 1000g is the gold standard for high-end units.
6. **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Don't forget to check if a seat is included. Some premium brands sell seats separately, which can add an unexpected cost. Also, ensure the flush lever or button is in a convenient location for your layout.

## FAQ

### What is the best high end toilet for beginners?
For those new to luxury toilets, a one-piece skirted model like the SOTOMO or Casta Diva is the best place to start. They offer a significant upgrade in flushing power and aesthetics without the complexity of smart electronics. They are easy to install and maintain while providing an immediate boost to your bathroom experience.

### How much should I spend on high end toilet?
You should expect to spend between $350 and $1,500 depending on the feature set. A solid one-piece ceramic toilet with a high MAP score usually lands in the $400 range. If you want smart features like bidets, heated seats, and auto-flush, the price usually starts around $800 and goes up based on technology.

### What features are most important in high end toilet?
The most important features are the MAP flush score (look for 1000g), a fully glazed trapway to prevent clogs, and WaterSense certification for efficiency. For comfort, an elongated bowl and ADA chair height are highly recommended as they provide a better ergonomic experience for most adults.

### How do I maintain my high end toilet?
Maintain your high-end toilet by using mild soap and water for the exterior. Avoid abrasive pads that can scratch the high-quality glaze. For smart toilets, regularly clean the bidet nozzle according to the manufacturer instructions and ensure the foam shield reservoir is refilled if your model includes that feature.

### Are expensive high end toilet worth it?
Yes, they are worth it for the improved hygiene, comfort, and water savings. Premium glazes keep the bowl cleaner, and high-performance flushing systems eliminate the frustration of clogs. Additionally, smart features can significantly reduce toilet paper use, saving money and benefiting the environment in the long run.

### What brands make the best high end toilet?
Brands like HOROW, SOTOMO, Casta Diva, and EPLO are currently leading the market in high-end toilets. They offer a range of products from standard luxury one-piece units to fully automated smart toilets. These brands are known for their reliable flushing mechanisms and modern designs.

### How long do high end toilet typically last?
A well-maintained high-end toilet can last 20 to 50 years. While the ceramic body is virtually permanent, the internal valves and smart electronics may need servicing or replacement every 10 to 15 years. Using high-quality components ensures that the main unit stays functional and beautiful for decades.

### Can I find good high end toilet on a budget?
Yes, many brands like Casta Diva and HOROW offer entry-level luxury models under $400. These models focus on high-performance flushing and modern one-piece designs without the expensive electronic bidet features, allowing you to get the luxury look and feel without breaking the bank.

## Final Verdict
