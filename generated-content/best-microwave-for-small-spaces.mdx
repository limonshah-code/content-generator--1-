  description="The Toshiba ML-EM09PA(BS) is a standout choice for those who need a bit more power than the standard 700W compact models. With 900W of output, it heats food faster and more evenly.

It is specifically designed to be easy to clean, with a durable exterior that resists scuffs."
  whySelected="We selected the Chefman for its innovative additions like the memory function and Eco Mode. These features are rare in the sub-$100 compact microwave market. It offers a lot of control for a small unit, making it great for people who like to customize their cooking experience beyond just hitting a popcorn button."

## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Microwave For Small Spaces

### 1. Find Your Need - Compatibility and use case considerations
Before you purchase a compact microwave, think about your primary use case. Are you mostly reheating coffee and frozen dinners, or do you plan to defrost meat and steam vegetables? If you only need it for light tasks, a 700W model is perfect. However, if you cook full meals, you might prefer a 900W or 1000W model that fits in a similar footprint. Also, measure your counter space and cabinet clearance carefully, leaving at least an inch for ventilation.

### 2. Budget - Setting realistic price expectations ($X-$Y ranges)
Small microwaves are generally affordable. You can find reliable entry-level models between $60 and $90. These usually offer 700W and basic features. If you move into the $100 to $150 range, you will see higher wattage (900W+), sensor cooking, and premium finishes like black stainless steel. Setting a budget early will help you decide if features like a mute button or smart sensor are worth the extra investment.

### 3. Key Features - Most important technical specifications
Look for features that enhance usability. A mute button is excellent for late-night use, while a child lock is essential for safety. Check the turntable size; a 10-inch or larger tray is necessary if you use standard dinner plates. One-touch express buttons (1-6 minutes) are massive time-savers. Lastly, check if it has a weight defrost option, as it is much more accurate than simple time defrosting.

### 4. Quality & Durability - What to look for in construction
In a small microwave, the door latch is often the first thing to fail. Look for models with a sturdy push-button or a high-quality pull handle like the Galanz Retro. Check user reviews for mentions of the turntable motor noise, as a grinding sound can indicate lower-quality components. Brands like Toshiba and Farberware are known for using more durable internal components even in their smaller units.

### 5. Brand Reputation - Importance of established manufacturers
While there are many off-brand options, sticking with established names like Toshiba, Black+Decker, and Farberware often ensures better customer support and warranty coverage. These brands have refined their compact technology over decades, leading to more even heating and better safety standards.

### 6. Portability/Size - Considerations for space and storage
Weight matters if you are a student moving every semester or an RV owner. Most 0.7 cu ft models weigh around 20-22 pounds, making them very portable. Also, consider the cord length and the plug type. Some plugs are flat and angled, which is better for tight spaces behind counters, while others stick straight out and may require more clearance.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy microwave for small spaces?

Investing in a microwave specifically designed for small spaces is a very smart decision for several reasons. First and foremost is the efficient use of your kitchen footprint. In many modern apartments and dorms, counter space is the most valuable commodity. A compact microwave allows you to have the convenience of modern cooking without sacrificing the room you need for food prep or other appliances like coffee makers or air fryers.

Compared to traditional full-sized microwaves, these compact units are also significantly more energy-efficient. Because they have a smaller internal cavity, they require less energy to heat the air and the food inside. For someone who only heats single portions or small snacks, a large 2.0 cu ft microwave is a waste of both space and electricity. Furthermore, modern small microwaves have closed the gap in technology. You can now get features like smart sensors and mute buttons that were once only found on high-end, large models. While they might take an extra minute to heat a large bowl of soup, the trade-off in space and cost makes them the superior choice for single occupants and small families.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose microwave for small spaces?

To choose the best small microwave, you should follow a systematic approach. Start by measuring the exact dimensions of where the microwave will sit. Do not forget to account for the depth, including the handle and the plug in the back. A common mistake is buying a unit that fits the width but sticks out too far on the counter.

Next, prioritize your must-have features. If you hate the loud beeping sound that most microwaves make, only look at models with a mute function (most Toshiba and Chefman models have this). If you have young children, ensure the child lock is easy for you to activate. Once you have a shortlist, check the wattage. If you are used to a powerful office microwave, a 700W home model might feel slow. If speed is your priority, look for the 900W Toshiba 0.9 cu ft models. Avoid the mistake of buying purely based on price; sometimes spending an extra twenty dollars gets you a much more durable door and a quiet motor that will last years longer. Finally, consider the interior height to ensure your favorite tall travel mugs or high bowls will actually fit inside.
