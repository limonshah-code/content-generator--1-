It comes with a 9.45-inch white planter that fits perfectly into modern home decors. The natural wood trunk provides a rustic elegance that pairs well with the vibrant green leaves and realistic olive fruits.

The branches are designed to sway gently if there is a breeze, adding to the lifelike experience within your home environment."
  whySelected="This model was selected for its versatility and value. Not every room can accommodate a 7-foot tree, and this 6-foot option provides the same realistic wood trunk and included planter at a more accessible size. We found the quality of the silk leaves to be superior to many competitors in this price range. It is the perfect middle-ground for someone who wants quality without over-powering their furniture."

  description="LuceAlberi offers a unique take on the artificial olive tree by including both a sturdy inner pot and a beautiful handwoven basket. This 6-foot tall tree features a realistic single trunk that branches out into multiple stems filled with silk leaves and plastic olive fruits. The branches contain internal wires which allow you to shape and position them to achieve the exact look you desire. It is designed to mimic the Mediterranean flair perfectly, making it a great addition to living rooms or sunrooms. The natural materials used in the basket mean each piece is unique and adds an organic touch to your interior design. Maintenance is as simple as a quick wipe with a damp cloth."
  whySelected="We included the LuceAlberi tree because of the added value provided by the woven basket. Most artificial trees require you to buy a basket separately to hide the small nursery pot, but this package includes everything you need. The ability to adjust the branches is a key feature that allows users to make the tree look wider or more upright depending on the space available."
  userExperience="Reviewers love the included basket, noting that it adds a warm and cozy feel to their rooms. The assembly process is rated as very easy since you only need to insert a few branches into the pre-assembled trunk. Many users suggest bending the leaves slightly downward to give it a more natural, gravity-affected look. The stability of the base inside the basket is also highly rated."

Like other faux plants, it requires no fertilizer or water and stays vibrant all year long. The branches are designed with a realistic texture that feels authentic even at a close distance."

By choosing a model with a basic black pot, you get a premium 7-foot tree without paying extra for a decorative planter you might not use. We were impressed by the structural integrity of the natural wood trunk which keeps the tall tree upright and sturdy."
  userExperience="Buyers often mention that this tree is the perfect canvas for their own decorating style. They appreciate the height and the realistic sway of the branches.

It features the same high-quality construction as the larger models, including a real wood trunk and lifelike silk leaves, but in a compact 60-inch frame. It comes with a 9.45-inch white tall planter that elevates the tree and adds to its modern aesthetic. This size is particularly good for placing on top of low furniture or in tight corners next to a sofa. It brings a touch of the Mediterranean to your home without crowding the room. Like its larger counterparts, it is completely maintenance-free and keeps its lush green appearance indefinitely."
  whySelected="We chose this model for its space-saving design. Not everyone has the ceiling height or floor space for a 7-foot tree. This 5-foot option provides the same level of realism and includes the stylish white planter, making it a complete decor solution for apartments, dorms, or small offices. It offers the same premium feel in a more manageable package."
  userExperience="Owners of small apartments rave about how this tree adds life to their space without making it feel cluttered. The included planter is highly praised for its clean and modern look. Users find it very easy to move around due to its lighter weight compared to the 7-foot versions. It is a popular choice for gifting during housewarmings."

  description="For the purist who wants a real piece of the Mediterranean, the Arbequina Olive Tree from American Plant Exchange is a fantastic choice. This is a live, fruit-bearing tree that comes in a 7.5-inch pot. It is known for its ability to grow indoors if provided with enough sunlight, and it produces high-quality olives that can be used for culinary purposes. The tree features slender, silvery-green leaves and a gnarled trunk that grows more beautiful with age. It is a cold-hardy variety that can also transition to a patio or garden. Having a live olive tree provides health benefits like improved air quality and the satisfaction of growing your own food."
  whySelected="We included this live option for those who have a green thumb and the right lighting conditions. Unlike the faux options, this tree offers an ever-changing natural beauty and the potential for a real harvest. The Arbequina variety was specifically chosen because it is one of the most adaptable and easy-to-care-for olive trees for home gardeners."
  userExperience="Gardeners enjoy the challenge and reward of growing a real olive tree. Reviews mention that the tree arrives well-packaged and healthy. Users love the authentic smell and the way the leaves change in the sunlight. While it requires more work than silk options, most users find the process of watering and caring for a live plant very therapeutic."

The tree is designed to withstand the test of time, maintaining its vibrant look without any need for sunlight or water. It is a cost-effective way to add a high-end look to your space."
  whySelected="This model is a top pick for those who want the realism of a VIVATREES product but at a more budget-friendly price point because it skips the tall decorative planter. We love the natural wood trunk which is far superior to the plastic trunks found on most budget trees. It provides a solid foundation for any interior design project."
  userExperience="Customers find this tree very easy to set up and style. They frequently mention that placing it in a larger ceramic pot with some moss on top makes it look like a thousand-dollar designer item. The durability of the silk leaves is a common point of praise, as they do not fall off easily even when the tree is moved."

  description="The Bellacat 7-foot artificial olive tree stands out due to its incredible attention to detail in the foliage and fruit. It features eight different colors of fruits to mimic various stages of ripeness, providing a level of realism that is hard to find elsewhere. The natural wood trunk and silk leaves give the tree an airy, realistic feel that doesn't look overly dense or fake. It comes with a non-decorative pot, so it is highly recommended to place it in a stylish planter that matches your room. This tree is a modern minimalist's dream, adding style and a touch of nature to offices, hotels, or large living spaces effortlessly."
  whySelected="We chose the Bellacat tree for its unique fruit color variations. While most faux trees use one or two colors for olives, this model's use of eight colors adds a layer of depth and realism. The natural wood trunk is also exceptionally well-crafted, making it a premium choice for those who are very discerning about their artificial plants."
  userExperience="Users are impressed by how high-end this tree looks once it is placed in a decorative pot. They often mention the 'airy' quality of the branches, which prevents the tree from looking like a solid block of green.

  description="The LYERSE 7-foot olive tree is engineered for both beauty and stability. It features a natural wood trunk and lifelike leaves, but its standout feature is the heavy nursery pot filled with cement to prevent children or pets from knocking it over. The tree's branches are reinforced with strong inner metal wires, allowing you to span them up to 37 inches in width for a lush and full appearance. It arrives with clear instructions for a tool-free assembly. This tree is perfect for creating a Mediterranean atmosphere in high-traffic areas where durability is just as important as aesthetics. Its dense foliage makes it look full and vibrant even in large, open-concept rooms."
  whySelected="Safety and stability were the primary reasons for selecting the LYERSE tree. In homes with active pets or kids, a tall tree can be a tipping hazard. The cement-weighted base of this model provides peace of mind. Additionally, the extra-wide branch span makes it one of the 'fullest' looking trees on our list, which is great for filling large voids in a room."
  userExperience="Reviews often highlight how sturdy the tree feels compared to other brands. Owners love that they can spread the branches out wide to cover more wall space. The realistic look of the natural wood pole is also a major plus. Many users mentioned that they followed the tip to use a larger planter, which further improved the stability and aesthetic."

  description="The FEELEAD 7-foot artificial olive tree is designed to be a versatile decor piece that works well for every day and special occasions. The sturdy branches are specifically noted for being strong enough to support mini lights or small pendants, making it a great alternative to a traditional Christmas tree or for festive parties. It features a realistic design with natural-looking leaves and fruits that stay evergreen throughout the year. The base is made of sturdy cement to ensure it stays upright. It is remarkably easy to assemble using the included tip labels. Whether you place it in your dining room or an office lobby, this tree adds a sophisticated touch of elegance that never goes out of style."
  whySelected="We chose this model because of its branch strength.

## What to Look for Before Buying the Best Olive Trees For Indoors

### Find Your Need
Before you make a purchase, decide if you want a faux tree or a live one. Faux trees are perfect for those who want zero maintenance and have low-light areas. Live trees like the Arbequina variety are better for people with a green thumb who can provide at least six hours of direct sunlight. Consider the ceiling height of your room as well. A 7-foot tree is stunning but can feel cramped in a small apartment with low ceilings.

### Budget
Realistic olive trees typically range from $80 to $250. Models on the lower end usually come in a basic black nursery pot and may require you to buy a decorative planter. Premium models often include high-quality planters, real wood trunks, and more complex fruit detailing. Setting a budget of around $130-$180 is usually the sweet spot for a high-quality, realistic 6-7 foot artificial tree.

### Key Features
Look for a natural wood trunk if you are buying an artificial tree. Plastic trunks often look fake and ruin the effect. Another key feature is the adjustability of the branches. Having internal metal wires allows you to fluff the tree and shape it to fit your corner perfectly. For live trees, ensure you are buying a variety that is suitable for indoor container growth.

### Quality & Durability
Quality in artificial trees is determined by the silk leaves and the weight of the base. Check for 'UV-resistant' or 'high-quality silk' to ensure the green doesn't fade into a blue or yellow tint over time. A cement-weighted base is crucial for tall trees to ensure they don't tip over. For live trees, check for a healthy root system and pest-free leaves upon arrival.

### Brand Reputation
Buying from established brands like VIVATREES or American Plant Exchange ensures you are getting a product that has been tested by thousands of other consumers. These brands often offer better packaging, which is vital for preventing broken branches during the shipping of such large items. They also tend to have better customer service if you encounter any issues with your tree.

### Portability/Size
Consider how often you might need to move the tree. A 7-foot tree with a cement base can be quite heavy. If you live in an apartment and move frequently, a 5 or 6-foot model might be more practical. Also, check the 'spread' or width of the tree to ensure it won't block walkways or interfere with your furniture.

## Is it A Wise Decision to Buy olive trees for indoors?

Investing in an olive tree for your indoor space is an excellent decision for both aesthetic and psychological reasons. Olive trees are timeless symbols of peace and abundance, and their muted, silvery-green palette fits perfectly into the modern 'organic modern' and 'Mediterranean' design trends that are currently dominating the industry. Unlike trendy decor that might look dated in a year, the classic silhouette of an olive tree remains stylish for decades.

From a value perspective, high-quality artificial olive trees are a one-time investment that pays for itself. Real plants often die due to improper lighting or watering, leading to a cycle of expensive replacements. A premium faux tree stays beautiful forever with zero additional cost. If you choose a live tree, you gain the added benefit of air purification and the unique joy of harvesting your own olives. Whether faux or live, these trees add a layer of sophistication and life to a room that few other pieces of furniture can match. They are especially useful for filling awkward 'dead' corners in a room, instantly making the space feel finished and professionally designed.

## What Is the Best Way to Choose olive trees for indoors?

To choose the perfect olive tree, start by measuring your ceiling height. You generally want at least 12-18 inches of clearance between the top of the tree and the ceiling so it doesn't look squashed. Next, look at the lighting in your room. If the room is dark, a live tree will struggle and eventually drop its leaves, so a faux tree is your best bet.

When evaluating artificial options, pay close attention to the trunk. A real wood trunk is the single most important factor in making a faux tree look authentic. Also, check the density of the leaves. A tree that is too dense can look like a green blob, while a tree that is too sparse can look cheap. Look for an 'airy' design where you can see some of the branch structure. Finally, decide on the base. If you want a 'ready-to-go' solution, buy a model that includes a decorative planter. If you want to save money and customize the look, buy a model with a basic black pot and source your own basket or ceramic planter. Avoid trees with very shiny plastic leaves, as these look the least realistic under indoor lighting.

## FAQ

### What is the best olive trees for indoors for beginners?
For beginners, an artificial 6-foot olive tree with a real wood trunk is the best choice. It provides the full aesthetic benefit of a Mediterranean plant without any of the stress of maintenance. You won't have to worry about sunlight, watering, or pests. Simply unpack it, fluff the branches, and your room is transformed.

### How much should I spend on olive trees for indoors?
You should expect to spend between $100 and $180 for a high-quality 6 to 7-foot artificial tree. While you can find cheaper options under $80, they often have plastic trunks and less realistic leaves. Investing a bit more ensures a natural wood trunk and a weighted base that won't tip over.

### What features are most important in olive trees for indoors?
The most important feature for a faux tree is a natural wood trunk. For a live tree, the variety (like Arbequina) and the health of the root system are paramount. In both cases, look for a stable, weighted base and adjustable branches that allow you to customize the plant's shape to your space.

### How do I maintain my olive trees for indoors?
Faux olive trees only require occasional dusting. You can use a damp cloth or a feather duster once a month to keep the leaves looking vibrant. Live olive trees require at least 6 hours of sunlight, well-draining soil, and watering only when the top inch of soil is dry.

### Are expensive olive trees for indoors worth it?
Yes, expensive artificial olive trees are worth it because they use better materials like real wood and high-grade silk. They look much more realistic and last longer than budget versions. For live trees, a higher price often means a more mature tree that is more likely to survive and produce fruit.

### What brands make the best olive trees for indoors?
VIVATREES is currently one of the most popular brands for artificial options due to their realistic wood trunks and included planters. For live trees, American Plant Exchange is highly reputable. Other brands like Bellacat and LYERSE are also well-regarded for their specific focus on detail and stability.

### How long do olive trees for indoors typically last?
A high-quality artificial olive tree can last 10 to 15 years or more if kept out of direct sunlight which could fade the leaves. A live olive tree can live for decades, or even centuries, if it is given the proper care, sunlight, and a large enough pot to grow into.

### Can I find good olive trees for indoors on a budget?
Yes, you can find good budget options by looking for trees that come in simple black nursery pots. This reduces the initial cost. You can then 'upcycle' the look by placing the tree in an affordable wicker basket or a thrifted ceramic pot and adding dried moss to the base.
